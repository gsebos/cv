                                I am a highly motivated, passionate and self-taught, IT enthusiast.

                                    Seb is an integral part of the College Office team, working in and with all teams in the College Office to support them with daily issues with IT and facilities. Whether a colleague is in the office or WFH, Seb is always happy to support them with their issues. He is proactive and engaged, friendly and professional, and above all else he is prompt and efficient at helping his colleagues when they need him in a pinch. I have had to pleasure to work more closely with Seb recently as he helped us set up the updated Student Administration SharePoint site from an admin perspective - working with me and my team to make the transition as seamless and pain-free as possible, and being informative and thorough in his communication throughout. It is because of his contributions - to a different team that he had no stake in, mind you - that we were able to launch the site ahead of schedule without any hiccups. This included regularly responding to Teams messages quickly, being happy to attend meetings and consistently actioning small tasks for an extended period. I know Seb acts this way with all his projects, and no doubt because of his work the College is in a much stronger position to deliver a better experience for both staff and students. I strongly recommend him for this [award] category.

                                    Seb has since Oct-23 worked with closely with the CSE Research Impact Manager to develop a new SharePoint site to allow high-level monitoring of ongoing impact across the college and a shared operational infrastructure for School impact colleagues to track and store evidence of impact including REF case study preparation. Seb has consistently responded to queries and feedback with detailed answers and suggestions as appropriate, and has been instrumental in creating this infrastructure which has been enthusiastically welcomed by School colleagues. Beyond CSE, the format (which would not have been possible to achieve without Seb's input) is also likely to be adopted by the other two colleges, and has kick-started an ERO-RIS-IS development project looking to integrate this SharePoint format with an existing relevant system (Pure) that has previously been considered not fit for purpose.

                                    During the last few months Sebastien took on additional duties relating to a special project for the Usher HR team. Sebastien has taken our ideas and suggestions and created a fantastic user friendly online form through Sharepoint. He has been extremely patient with our questions and testing and has built the form from nothing into a project the HR team are really pleased with (including html coding, design, etc etc). We would not have been able to do this without his vision and expertise and he has done this in addition to his usual extremely busy PGR Support role. I would like a voucher to show our appreciation and to thank him for his hard work and support. He will be missed when he moves to his new role.
